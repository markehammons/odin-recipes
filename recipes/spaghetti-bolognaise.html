      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

         <li>Butter</li>
         <li>Tomato concentrate</li>
         <li>Garlic</li>
         <li>Parsley</li>
         <li>Red wine vinegar</li>

         <li>Soy sauce</li>
         <li>Ground beef</li>
         <li>Spaghetti</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>Fill a pot with water and start it to boil</li>
         <li>While the pot is reaching a boil, take a much smaller pot, and add your tomato concentrate</li>
         <li>To the tomato concentrate, add a cube of beef bouillon, a splash of red wine vinegar, a drizzle of soy sauce, and a tablespoon or two of butter</li>
         <li>Set the sauce to cook at low heat, stirring occasionally</li>
         <li>Take a frying pan, and start cooking your ground beef. Chop it up with a spatula, and again drizzle soy sauce. Cook the ground beef on medium heat</li>
         <li>Once the pot with water reaches a boil, add the spaghetti. Approximately 100g per person. Cook it for the time recommended on the package minus two minutes, and at medium high heat</li>
         <li>Once the juice is being released from the hamburger meat and it's appropriately brown throughout, put it and its juices in the tomato sauce and continue cooking at low heat</li>
         <li>Once the pasta has cooked for the recommended time minus two minutes, strain it, return it to its pot, and add the tomato sauce. Don't strain the pasta completely</li>
         <li>Cook the pasta in the sauce for about 4 more minutes, or until the sauce has thickened enough to stick to the pasta</li>
         <li>Serve!</li>
      </ol>

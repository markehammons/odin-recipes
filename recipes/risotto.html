      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Chicken Breast</li>
         <li>Arborio Rice</li>
         <li>Butter</li>
         <li>Garlic</li>
         <li>Chicken Broth</li>
         <li>White wine</li>
         <li>Chopped Mushroom</li>
         <li>Parsley</li>
         <li>Parmesan Cheese (freshly grated or sliced)</li>
         <li>Olive oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
         <li>In a large pot, bring a quantity of chicken broth to boil (don't worry about making too much, worry about making too little). You can use chicken bouillon instead</li>
         <li>In a separate pot chop up mushrooms and garlic and simmer them at medium heat in olive oil. Only use enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan</li>
         <li>Once the chicken broth is ready reduce the heat on the mushroom and garlic, and add some butter</li>
         <li>Measure out about 75g of risotto per person you'll be serving and add to the first pot</li>
         <li>After cooking the rice/mushroom/garlic mixture at medium heat for about 3 minutes, reduce the heat on the mixture to medium-low</li>
         <li>Add wine to the mixture and chopped parsley. You should add enough to halfway soak the rice you added</li>
         <li>Start ladling chicken broth into the rice/mushroom/garlic mixture. Use one ladle-full at a time, and wait for the rice to absorb the liquid till it's a bit sticky before adding more. Stir as the mixture is being absorbed to keep anything from burning</li>
         <li>Continue the above step for about 25 minutes</li>
         <li>Start cooking the chicken breast on high temperature in a seperate pan, stirring and flipping the chicken to get it evenly cooked</li>
         <li>Once the chicken is releasing its juices, reduce the temperature and keep it warm</li>
         <li>While the chicken is cooking, keep ladeling broth into the rice mixture for another 9 minutes</li>
         <li>Add the chicken and parmesan to the mixture. I typically add half a wedge of parmesan (60g) for two people, but you add as per your tastes. Stir for the next three minutes, until the risotto starts getting sticky</li>
         <li>While stirring, taste the cream from the risotto. If it's not flavorful enough, add salt until it tastes good to you</li>
         <li>Serve hot!</li>
      </ol>
